# lightspeed
lightspeed is a `hotkey launcher` written in python

 (inspired by Power Keys: https://powerkeys.github.io/)

only support windows 

the key feature is `speed` and  `wakeup`, wake up the program if it's already running , or open it if it's not running.  

## install
requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
run ( run in unimportant floder , script will create floders and config file ðŸ˜¥) 
```
python lightspeed.py
```

after testing , `create_shortcut.bat` can help u create a desktop shortcut . 

and you can put the shortcut in `shell:startup` to run it at startup .

## quick start

1. `1 ~ 9 + enter` to open the lightspeed folder 
2. put whatever you want in the folder , then reload hotkey ,
3. now you can open it with `1 ~ 9 + first letter` :
4. use `hard reload` when stuck

##  change the hotkey

e.g. `1 + c` to open chrome , 

change `chrome.lnk` to`[x]chrome.lnk` , then you can use `1 + X` to open chrome now

other hotkey like `ctrl + shift + f12` to open config file , can be change in `assests\config.json`

## config

script will auto generated `assests\config.json`  at first run 

```
{
    "folder_root_path": "",
    "notifiction": "off",
    "auto_hide": "off",
    "open_floder_key": "enter",
    "reload_key": "ctrl+f12",
    "open_config_key": "ctrl+shift+f12"
}
```

> config file will be added more features in the future
