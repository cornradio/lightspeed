 (inspired by Power Keys: https://powerkeys.github.io/)



only support windows for now , sorry mac and linux users , i will try to make it cross platform in the future

1. `1 ~ 9 + enter` to open the lightspeed folder 
2. `1 ~ 9 + first letter` of the lnk name to open the lnk file (windows shortcut file) , e.g. `1 + c` to open chrome)
3. `ctrl F12` to reload the hotkeys (in case you add new files)
4. just `alt + drag` to create new lnk files, dont change name of the lnk files ,script uses name to decide to reopen or wake up program


## progress 
- [x] create floders
- [x] create shortcuts for folders 1 ~ 9
- [x] read lnk files and create shortcuts
- [x] reload shortcuts 
- [x] fix stuck problem , still don't know why (fixed , it because my ahk alt Q have a flaw)
- [x] support custom hotkeys like add [Q] to the start of the lnk name to open it with `number + q`
- [x] support config file -- quick input -- quick typer!
- [x] gui for keymap viewing -- i think view it in terminal is just fine
