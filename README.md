# lightspeed
lightspeed is a `hotkey launcher` written in python

 (inspired by Power Keys: https://powerkeys.github.io/)

## Usage
only support windows for now , sorry mac and linux users , i will try to make it cross platform in the future

1. `1 ~ 9 + enter` to open the lightspeed folder 
2. `1 ~ 9 + first letter` of the lnk name to open the lnk file (windows shortcut file) , e.g. `1 + c` to open chrome)
3. `1+2+3 press together` to reload the hotkeys (in case you add new files)
4. just `alt + drag` to create new lnk files, dont change name of the lnk files ,script uses name to decide to reopen or wake up program
